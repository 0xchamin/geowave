Screenshots below are of data loaded from the various attributed data sets into a Geowave instance, processed (in some cases) by a Geowave analytic process, and rendered by Geoserver.  The background images are from Mapbox and are &copy;Mapbox as well as &copy;OpenStreeMap for the cartographic information.



## Microsoft Research T-drive
Microsoft research has made available a trajectory data set that contains the GPS coordinates of 10,357 taxis in Beijing, China and surrounding areas over a one week period.
There are approximately 15 million points in this data set.

### T-drive at city scale

[T-drive density at city scale](https://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/assets/images/t-drive-density-1.jpg)

Above is the t-drive data set displaying both the raw points, as well as the results of a Geowave kernel density analytic.  The data corresponds to Mapbox zoom level 12.  

### T-drive at block scale

This data set corresponds to a Mapbox zoom level of 15

### T-drive at house scale
