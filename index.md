# Geowave

## About

GeoWave is an open source set of software that:

* Adds multi-dimensional indexing capability to [Apache Accumulo](http://projects.apache.org/projects/accumulo.html) 
* Adds support for geographic objects and geospatial operators to [Apache Accumulo](http://projects.apache.org/projects/accumulo.html) 
* Contains a [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) plugin to allow geospatial data in Accumulo to be shared and visualized via OGC standard services
* Provides Map-Reduce input and output formats for distributed processing and analysis of geospatial data

Basically, GeoWave attempts to do for Accumulo as PostGIS does for PostgreSQL.


## Origin

GeoWave was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [RadiantBlue Technologies](http://www.radiantblue.com/) and [Booz Allen Hamilton](http://www.boozallen.com/).  The government has ["unlimited rights"](https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/blob/master/NOTICE) and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) license.
