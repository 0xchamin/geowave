(Source code will be uploaded Monday June 9th). Just getting the licensing and credits in place. 

GeoWave is a multi-dimensional indexing layer that can be added on top of any sorted key-value store.  Think of it this way: GeoWave does for Accumulo what PostGIS does for PostgreSQL.  


GeoWave was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [RadiantBlue Technologies](http://www.radiantblue.com/) and [Booz Allen Hamilton](http://www.boozallen.com/).  The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the Apache 2.0 license.
