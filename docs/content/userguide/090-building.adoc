== Building

GeoWave will shortly be available in Maven central for tagged releases. Until then, or to get the latest features, building GeoWave from source is the best bet. For more information on building GeoWave, please refer to the link:http://locationtech.github.io/geowave/devguide.html#building[GeoWave Developer Guide, window="_blank"].


=== Docker Build Process

We have support for building both the GeoWave jar artifacts and RPMs from Docker containers. This capability is useful for a number of different situations:

* Jenkins build workers can run Docker on a variety of host operating systems and build for others.
* Anyone running Docker will be able to duplicate our build and packaging environments.
* Developers can build on existing container clusters instead of single purpose build VMs.

If building artifacts using Docker containers interests, you check out the _README_ in `deploy/packaging/docker`
