{"name":"Geowave","tagline":"GeoWave provides geospatial and temporal indexing on top of Accumulo","body":"# GeoWave 0.8.0\r\n\r\n## About  \r\n\r\nGeoWave is an open source set of software that:\r\n\t\r\n* Adds multi-dimensional indexing capability to [Apache Accumulo](http://projects.apache.org/projects/accumulo.html) \r\n* Adds support for geographic objects and geospatial operators to [Apache Accumulo](http://projects.apache.org/projects/accumulo.html) \r\n* Contains a [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) plugin to allow geospatial data in Accumulo to be shared and visualized via OGC standard services\r\n* Provides Map-Reduce input and output formats for distributed processing and analysis of geospatial data\r\n\r\nBasically, GeoWave attempts to do for Accumulo as PostGIS does for PostgreSQL.  \r\n\r\n## Origin\r\n\r\nGeoWave was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [RadiantBlue Technologies](http://www.radiantblue.com/) and [Booz Allen Hamilton](http://www.boozallen.com/).  The government has [\"unlimited rights\"](https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/blob/master/NOTICE) and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions.

The software has specifically been run on [Cloudera](http://cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/home.html) CDH4 and [Hortonworks Data Platform](http://hortonworks.com/hdp/) 2.1.   \r\n\r\nMapReduce 1 with the new API (org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.*) is used.  Testing is underway against YARN / MR2 and seems to be positive, but well, it's still underway.  \r\n\r\n[Java Advanced Imaging](http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/) and [Java Image I/O](http://download.java.net/media/jai-imageio/builds/release/1.1/) are also both required to be installed on the GeoServer instance(s) *as well* as on the Accumulo nodes.  The Accumulo support is only required for certain functions (distributed rendering) - so this may be skipped in some cases.\r\n\r\n### Building: Maven!\r\n\r\nSince GeoWave isn't currently in maven central we will build and install a local copy\r\n\r\n\t$ git clone git@github.com:ngageoint/geowave.git\r\n\t$ cd geowave && mvn install \r\n\r\nIf everything worked as expected you should see something like\r\n\r\n    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    [INFO] Reactor Summary:\r\n    [INFO]\r\n    [INFO] geowave-parent ....................................

Accumulo (in 1.5) leverages the Apache VFSClassloader to provide an easy way to do this in one shot - load dependencies out of HDFS.  Unfortunately we have a current bug (**GEOWAVE-28**) where the hdfs URI breaks some SPI injection fixes we have in place.  So until this is addressed you need to distribute this jar (*geowave-gt-0.7.0-accumulo-singlejar.jar*) to each tabled server, on the accumulo classpath ( $ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/ext/  is the default choice ).  \r\n\r\n### GeoWave System Integration Test\r\n\r\nThe geowave-test module will run end-to-end integration testing on either a configured Accumulo instance or a temporary MiniAccumuloCluster.  It will ingest both point and line features spatially and temporally from shapefiles and test that spatial and spatial-temporal queries match expected results.\r\n\r\nA specific Accumulo instance can be configured either directly within this pom.xml or as Java options -DzookeeperUrl=&lt;zookeeperUrl&gt; -Dinstance=&lt;instance&gt; -Dusername=&lt;username&gt; -Dpassword=&lt;password&gt;\r\n\r\nIf any of these configuration parameters are left unspecified the default integration test will use a MiniAccumuloCluster created within a temporary directory.  For this to work on Windows, make sure Cygwin is installed and a \"CYGPATH\" environment variable must reference the &lt;CYGWIN_HOME&gt;/bin/cygpath.exe file.  \r\n\r\n### Ingest Data\r\n\r\n*Coming Soon! With useful details!*\r\n\r\n(basically see  geowave-ingest::mil.nga.giat.geowave.ingest.VectorFileIngest for an example that can ingest any geotools supported format) \r\n\r\n\r\n### View in GeoServer\r\n\r\n*Coming Soon! With screenshots as well!*\r\n\r\n(basically add a GeoWave data store through the add datastore menu and configure the layer like normal)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
